The code controls digitially addressable RGB LEDs through a web interface using an Arduino
microcontroller.

A LICENSE file is included with the documentation. My intention is that anyone can use
this code for their own use. However, the code should always remain free for others
to use, share, and change.

The Arduino code is meant to be uploaded to an Arduino microcontroller with an ethernet
capability using the Arduino IDE. The files ending in "_old" are simply archives
included for reference.

The web code is designed to be included on a web server on the same local network as the
microcontroller. Again, the files ending in "_old" are simply archives included for
reference. The system is made to operate using TCP over port 1234, but it could be
configured to use any port.
